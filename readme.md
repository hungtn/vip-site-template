# VIP Go Site Boilerplate

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/xwp/vip-go-site.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/xwp/vip-go-site)


A modern setup for [WordPress VIP Go](https://vip.wordpress.com/documentation/vip-go/) hosted projects:

- üè≠ Uses Composer for adding project dependencies, including plugins and themes.
- üåé Uses Composer autoloader for using any of the popular PHP packages anywhere in the codebase.
- üë©‚Äçüíª Provides a local development environment based on Docker that can be run inside Vagrant without having to install Docker on the host machine.
- üöÄ Includes an automated build and deploy pipeline for deployments to WordPress VIP Go.


## Requirements

- PHP 7.2 or higher
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org)
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) or [Docker with Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

We suggest using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) for installing all project dependencies.


## Overview

- Project plugins and themes can be added as Composer dependencies or manualy to this repository under `public/plugins/your-plugin` and `public/themes/your-theme`.

- Composer dependencies are placed under `public/plugins/vendor`.

- Composer autoloader `public/plugins/vendor/autoload.php` is included in `public/vip-config/vip-config.php`.

- [Composer installers](https://github.com/composer/installers) maps WordPress plugins, themes and mu-plugins to sub-directories under `public`.


## Setup

1. Create a fresh Git repository from this reference repository:

		composer create-project xwp/vip-go-site --stability dev

2. Add your theme and plugins as Composer dependencies:

		composer require your/theme your/plugin another/plugin

	or by manually copying them from existing repositories to `public/themes` or `public/plugins`. Remember to start tracking those directories by excluding them in `public/themes/.gitignore` and `public/plugins/.gitignore`.


### Local Development Setup

3. If using Docker inside Vagrant, adjust the hostname of the development environment in `Vagrantfile` to match your project.

		- config.vm.hostname = "vipgo"
		+ config.vm.hostname = "your-project"
	
	which will create the development environment at `your-project.local`.

4. Start the development environment using Vagrant:

		vagrant up

	or using Docker Compose:

		docker-compose up

5. Visit [your-project.local](http://your-project.local) (or the default [vipgo.local](http://vipgo.local)) to view the development environment. 


## Deployments

Deployments to the VIP Go upstream repository are handled by `scripts/deploy.sh` which does a clean checkout of the deploy branch to `deploy/src`, runs the build pipeline and copies the the `public` directory with the resulting artifects to `deploy/dist` (using `rsync`) which contains the upstream VIP Go repository. It then creates a new branch with the new changes and pushes it to the upstream repository.

### Configure Deployments

1. Change the repository URL for `deploy-staging` and `deploy-production` scripts in `package.json` to match your VIP Go upstream repository.

2. Adjust the build sequence in `scripts/deploy.sh` to match your setup.

3. Run `npm run deploy-staging` to deploy to the `develop` branch or `npm run deploy-production` to deploy to the `master` branch of the upstream VIP Go repository.

4. Visit GitHub to open a pull request to the deploy target branch.


## Maintance Tasks

- Keep the `public` directory in sync with any updates to the [VIP Go skeleton repository](https://github.com/automattic/vip-go-mu-plugins-built). It is not added as a project dependency because it requires plugins and themes to be placed _inside_ it.
